<gshan> memory: malloc() and free()
<gshan>  
<gshan> (1) memory (for client instance) should be allocated/free'd dynamically
<gshan>    malloc/free
<gshan> (2) The clients on server side should be chained using double-linked list.
<gshan>       (or single list)
<gshan> (3) the code of double/single list can be put into list.c
<gshan> (4) alternatively, the clients can be put into a binary tree
<gshan>      (the code of binary tree can be put into tree.c)
<gshan>  
<gshan> Tree: red-black tree, binary tree, Radix tree
